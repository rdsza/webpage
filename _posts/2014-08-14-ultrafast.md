Ultrafast dynamics refers to the study of physical and chemical processes that occur on femtosecond ($10^{-15}$ s) to picosecond ($10^{-12}$ s) timescales. At these timescales, we can observe the fundamental motions of atoms and electrons during chemical reactions, phase transitions, and energy transfer processes.

## Why Ultrafast?

Chemical bonds break and form on the timescale of a single molecular vibration — roughly 10 to 100 femtoseconds. To capture these events in real time, we need experimental techniques with comparable temporal resolution. This is the domain of ultrafast spectroscopy, which uses short laser pulses to initiate ("pump") and observe ("probe") molecular dynamics.

## Pump-Probe Spectroscopy

The workhorse of ultrafast science is the pump-probe experiment:

1. A **pump pulse** excites the system, initiating a photophysical or photochemical process.
2. After a controlled time delay $\Delta t$, a **probe pulse** interrogates the system to measure changes in absorption, emission, or diffraction.
3. By varying $\Delta t$, one builds up a "molecular movie" of the evolving system.

Common variants include transient absorption spectroscopy, time-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy (TRPES), and ultrafast electron diffraction (UED).

## Wavepacket Dynamics

When a short laser pulse excites a molecule, it creates a coherent superposition of vibrational states — a **wavepacket**. This wavepacket evolves on the potential energy surface, oscillating back and forth much like a classical particle. Tracking these wavepacket dynamics provides direct insight into:

- The shape of potential energy surfaces
- Barrier heights and transition states
- Coupling between electronic and nuclear degrees of freedom

Ab initio molecular dynamics methods, such as trajectory surface hopping, allow us to simulate these processes computationally and compare directly with experimental observables.

## Applications

Ultrafast dynamics studies have been instrumental in understanding:

- **Photochemical reactions**: Ring-opening, isomerization, and bond dissociation events captured in real time.
- **Charge transfer**: Electron and proton transfer processes in molecular and solid-state systems.
- **Biological processes**: Light harvesting in photosynthesis, the primary event in vision (rhodopsin isomerization), and DNA photoprotection mechanisms.
- **Materials science**: Phase transitions, carrier dynamics in semiconductors, and lattice dynamics probed by ultrafast X-ray or electron diffraction.
