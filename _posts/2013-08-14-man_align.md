Manifold alignment is a problem of finding a common latent space where we jointly perform dimensionality reduction on multiple datasets that preserves any correspondence between those datasets. Before we dive into the details of manifold alignment, let’s understand first what is Manifold.

Manifold : Introduction
======
An n-dimensional manifold is a most general mathematical space with limits, continuity, and correctness as well as allows the existence of the continuous inverse function with n-dimensional Euclidean spaces¹. Manifolds locally resemble Euclidean space but they may not be Euclidean space. Essentially, a manifold is a generalization of Euclidean space.

In topology, two objects are considered to be of the same shape if one can be
deformed into the other without cutting or gluing. Objects with
the same shape are called homeomorphic. Manifolds are homeomorphic to Euclidean spaces.
