Manifold alignment is a problem of finding a common latent space where we jointly perform dimensionality reduction on multiple datasets that preserves any correspondence between those datasets. Before we dive into the details of manifold alignment, let's understand first what a manifold is.

## Manifold: Introduction

An n-dimensional manifold is a topological space that locally resembles $\mathbb{R}^n$. More precisely, every point on a manifold has a neighborhood that is homeomorphic to an open subset of Euclidean space. Manifolds locally resemble Euclidean space but globally they may have very different topology. Essentially, a manifold is a generalization of Euclidean space.

In topology, two objects are considered to be of the same shape if one can be deformed into the other without cutting or gluing. Objects with the same shape are called homeomorphic. A familiar example: the surface of the Earth is a 2-dimensional manifold embedded in 3D space. Locally, it looks flat (like $\mathbb{R}^2$), but globally it has a spherical topology.

## The Problem of Manifold Alignment

Given two or more datasets $\mathbf{X}_1 \in \mathbb{R}^{n_1 \times d_1}$ and $\mathbf{X}_2 \in \mathbb{R}^{n_2 \times d_2}$, manifold alignment seeks mappings $f_1$ and $f_2$ into a shared low-dimensional space $\mathbb{R}^k$ such that:

- **Local geometry** within each dataset is preserved (neighborhood structure).
- **Known correspondences** between datasets are respected (matched points map to nearby locations).

This is particularly useful when datasets come from different modalities or measurement techniques but describe the same underlying phenomenon.

## Approaches to Manifold Alignment

### Procrustes-Based Alignment

If both datasets are already embedded in low-dimensional spaces, one can use Procrustes analysis to find the optimal rotation, translation, and scaling that aligns corresponding points. This is simple but requires pre-computed embeddings and point-to-point correspondences.

### Semi-Supervised Alignment

Semi-supervised manifold alignment uses a combination of:

1. **Similarity graphs** $W_1$ and $W_2$ capturing local structure within each dataset.
2. **Correspondence matrix** $W_{12}$ encoding known matches between datasets.

A joint graph Laplacian is constructed and its smallest eigenvectors provide the aligned embedding. The objective function balances two competing goals:

$$\min_{f_1, f_2} \sum_{ij} W_1(i,j) \|f_1(x_i) - f_1(x_j)\|^2 + \sum_{ij} W_2(i,j) \|f_2(y_i) - f_2(y_j)\|^2 + \mu \sum_{ij} W_{12}(i,j) \|f_1(x_i) - f_2(y_j)\|^2$$

The first two terms preserve local geometry within each dataset, while the third term enforces cross-dataset correspondences.

### Unsupervised Alignment

When no correspondences are known, unsupervised methods rely on structural similarity between the manifolds. Techniques like canonical correlation analysis (CCA), or optimal transport-based methods, attempt to find alignments by matching distributional or geometric properties.

## Applications

Manifold alignment has found applications in:

- **Multi-modal data fusion**: Combining data from different sensors or imaging modalities (e.g., cryo-EM and X-ray crystallography).
- **Transfer learning**: Aligning feature spaces across domains to enable knowledge transfer.
- **Cross-lingual NLP**: Mapping word embeddings from different languages into a shared space.
- **Computational biology**: Integrating single-cell RNA-seq data across experiments, or reconciling conformational landscapes from different structural biology techniques.
