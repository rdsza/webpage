Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) is a powerful technique for studying the structures of biological macromolecules such as proteins and nucleic acids. In cryo-EM, samples are rapidly frozen in liquid ethane at cryogenic temperatures, which preserves their native structures and prevents the formation of ice crystals that can damage the samples. The samples are then imaged using an electron microscope, which allows researchers to determine the three-dimensional structures of the macromolecules at resolutions that are often higher than those obtained by X-ray crystallography.

One important application of cryo-EM is the study of protein-ligand interactions. Ligands are small molecules that bind to proteins and play important roles in cellular processes such as signaling, metabolism, and regulation. By determining the structures of protein-ligand complexes, researchers can gain insights into the mechanisms of these interactions and develop new drugs that target specific proteins.

Cryo-EM is particularly well-suited for studying protein-ligand interactions because it allows researchers to capture images of the complexes in their native, biologically relevant states. Additionally, cryo-EM does not require the crystallization of the samples, which can be difficult or impossible for some proteins and ligands.

Recent advances in cryo-EM technology, such as the development of direct electron detectors and improved image processing algorithms, have allowed researchers to determine structures at ever-higher resolutions. This has led to a surge in the number of protein-ligand complexes structures determined by cryo-EM and has opened new possibilities for drug discovery and the understanding of biological systems.

In conclusion, cryo-EM is a powerful technique for studying the structure of biological macromolecules and its application to protein-ligand interactions has proven to be a valuable tool for drug discovery and understanding the underlying mechanisms of biological systems.
