Maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) is a method for estimating the parameters of a probability distribution based on a set of observations. The idea behind MLE is to find the parameter values that make the observed data most probable. The basic equation for MLE is:

L(θ|x) = P(x|θ)

Where L(θ|x) is the likelihood function, θ is the parameter vector, and x is the observed data. The maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) of θ is the value of θ that maximizes the likelihood function. This is typically found by taking the derivative of the log-likelihood function with respect to θ and setting it equal to zero, then solving for θ.

lnL(θ|x) = ln P(x|θ)

∂lnL(θ|x) / ∂θ = 0

The MLE of θ is the value that maximizes this equation.

It is important to note that MLE may not always exist, may not be unique, or may not be a good estimator of the parameter. It's a good idea to check if the assumptions of MLE holds before using it in a practical context.
