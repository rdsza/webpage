Hello there!

Iâ€™m Raison, currently working as an [Assistant Scientist](https://morgridge.org/profile/raison-dsouza/) in the Morgridge Institute for Research with [Tim Grant](https://morgridge.org/profile/tim-grant/).
I obtained a Ph.D. from the University of Hamburg, Germany in Molecular Physics (Simulations/Theory). Much of my graduate work was carried out at the [Max Planck Institute for the Structure and Dynamics of Matter](https://www.mpsd.mpg.de/en) in the lab of [Dwayne Miller](https://lphys.chem.utoronto.ca/) working on new methods to understand wavepacket dynamics of the nuclear wavefunction using ab initio methods in order to elucidate spatio-temporally resolved dynamics.

My current research involves using latest advances in machine learning and signal processing to extract the particle poses (orientations and positions) from cryo-electron microscopy images. I am developing newer features into the 2D Template Matching method implemented in [cisTEM](https://cistem.org/software).
