Hi!Iâ€™m Raison, currently working as an [Assistant Scientist](https://morgridge.org/profile/raison-dsouza/) in the Morgridge Institute for Research with [Tim Grant](https://morgridge.org/profile/tim-grant/).
I obtained a Ph.D. in Physics obtained from Universitaet Hamburg. Much of my graduate work was carried out at the [Max Planck Institute for the Structure and Dynamics of Matter](https://www.mpsd.mpg.de/en) in the lab of [Dwayne Miller](https://lphys.chem.utoronto.ca/) working on new methods to implement time dependent ab initio methods to provide theoretical support for the atomically resolved structural dynamics.

My current research involves using latest advances in machine learning and signal processing to extract the particle poses (orientations and positions) from cryo-electron microscopy images.

## Manifold-based Machine learning : Laplacian Eigenmaps

Creating acceptable representations for complex data is one of the main challenges in pattern recognition and machine learning. Laplacian Eigenmaps algorithm offers a locality-preserving, computationally effective method for nonlinear dimensionality reduction with a close relationship to clustering. 

## Allosteric communication aligned with molecular breathing
<!--- ====== -->
Enzymes often form dimers or higher-order oligomers, even when each active site is isolated and the reactions are simple. But the effect of a neighbor can be profound. Mehrabi et al. used a photolabile compound to initiate a reaction in the enzyme fluoroacetate dehalogenase, which they could follow by time-resolved serial synchrotron crystallography. Snapshots of the reaction revealed coupled allosteric motions between the two active sites of the dimeric enzyme. Each active site traded the ability to bind substrate and catalyze the reaction, such that only one was engaged at a time. This behavior is common in enzymes but is rarely visualized and still poorly understood.

## Ultrafast coherent nuclear dynamics
<!--- ====== -->
This study represents a pilot application of dynamical simulations based on the
ADC(2) method in the interpretation of the TRPES spectra of aliphatic amines. Taking,
as a test case, the compound NMM, the relaxation dynamics was simulated with the use
of the BOMD method. The simulated trajectories subsequently formed the basis for the
calculation of the TRPES spectrum.

<!-- In case we use kernel models, $g_{\theta}(X, X')$ is identical to the reproducing kernel and is constant during the entire optimization process. If we use NNs, this kernel is known as Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) [[Jacot et al., 2018]](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2018/hash/5a4be1fa34e62bb8a6ec6b91d2462f5a-Abstract.html), and is time-variant. My study of NTK and its dynamics during NN learning process emphasizes the importance of the model kernel adaptation to the specific target function for a good learning outcome (see Section 14 of thesis for more details).
