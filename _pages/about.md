Hello there!

I'm Raison, an [Assistant Scientist](https://morgridge.org/profile/raison-dsouza/) at the [Morgridge Institute for Research](https://morgridge.org/) working with [Tim Grant](https://morgridge.org/profile/tim-grant/). My work sits at the intersection of machine learning, signal processing, and cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM). I build computational tools and reproducible workflows that extract useful signal from noisy EM images of frozen cell sections — currently focused on developing the 2D Template Matching method in [cisTEM](https://cistem.org/software).

Before joining Morgridge, I was a [BioXFEL](https://www.bioxfel.org/) Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee with [Abbas Ourmazd](https://uwm.edu/physics/people/ourmazd-abbas/) and [Peter Schwander](https://uwm.edu/physics/people/schwander-peter/), where I developed machine learning algorithms for mapping conformational heterogeneity of biomolecules from cryo-EM snapshots.

I hold a Ph.D. in Computational Physics (*magna cum laude*) from the [University of Hamburg](https://www.uni-hamburg.de/en.html), where my graduate research was carried out at the [Max Planck Institute for the Structure and Dynamics of Matter](https://www.mpsd.mpg.de/en) in the lab of [Dwayne Miller](https://lphys.chem.utoronto.ca/). There I used ab initio quantum chemical methods to elucidate ultrafast molecular photochemistry and nuclear wavepacket dynamics.

**Research interests:** cryo-EM image analysis, scientific workflow infrastructure, reproducible pipelines (Docker, Snakemake, HPC/SLURM), scalable data formats (Zarr, HDF5), conformational dynamics, and machine learning for structural biology.
